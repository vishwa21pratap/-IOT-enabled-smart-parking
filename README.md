Smart Parking System using IoT with Buzzer and LED Lights

Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Smart Parking System implemented using IoT (Internet of Things) technology. The system utilizes sensors, a microcontroller, LED lights, and a buzzer to indicate the availability of parking spaces in real-time. This README file provides an overview of the project, including its components, setup instructions, and usage.

Components
IoT Device: This is the heart of the system, typically consisting of a microcontroller (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi) with Wi-Fi connectivity.
Ultrasonic Sensors: These sensors are used to detect the presence of vehicles in parking spaces.
LED Lights: LED lights are used to visually indicate the availability of parking spaces. Green indicates an available space, while red indicates an occupied space.
Buzzer: A buzzer is used to provide an audible alert when a vehicle enters or leaves a parking space.
Setup Instructions
Hardware Setup:

Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the microcontroller according to the wiring diagram provided.
Connect the LED lights and buzzer to the microcontroller as per the schematic.
Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated.
Software Setup:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Upload the provided Arduino or Raspberry Pi code to the microcontroller.
Install any necessary libraries or dependencies specified in the code.
Configuration:
Testing:

Power on the system and observe the behavior of the LED lights and buzzer as vehicles enter and leave parking spaces.
Verify that the system accurately detects parking space availability and updates the status in real-time.
